[Grey] So Brady, we've been away for a while. What have you been up to during our little hiatus?
[Brady] This is the big question. I've been eating a lot of junk food. No, I'm not fat. I'm not fat. But it doesn't really count. What are they? What are they eating?
[Grey] That's a good question. I have been eating a lot of junk food over the past several weeks. That is not good. And I don't know what it is. What are they? What are they? It's like, I swear to God, the amount of sugar that I have consumed over the past several weeks. It's it's ridiculous. It's like I can't believe that what is occurring in this world is so similar to what was occurring before my calorie counting started. I have not eaten a single candy since my first time like that. That was my first experience with this. There was no like, no candy. Nothing in the house. It was just all like the dieticians like there was nothing to eat in the house. And I swear, like when my wife brought home from dinner, she was brought some cookies from like, some cookies from a candy company. Yeah, that's what was in the fridge like I had no idea what it was. And so I swear that the the little bit of a sweet candy was wasn't half bad. It was nothing like that. It was a kind of like a triangle. I had a difficult childhood because I was so sugar intolerant. That's why I am so curious to hear what is the true story behind the term. And what is the speculation of what is occurring with me? But anyway, so I think about it. Now, one of the one of the consequences of my dietary, and particularly since my last visit, is that I have been getting a lot of really good advice from people in my life, who who who want to give me good advice. And because of that, I think I have ended up in the same kind of thing like sort of like, Yeah, I've been like a few people, and I've been getting a lot of really good advice. And people who tell me, Oh, you should try this and this and the flip, I've been getting a lot of really good advice. And I've ended up in the same kind of place. And I've been like, I've been on like a holiday and I've been on a few walks and my body just feels so full of sugar, and carbs and proteins, and proteins and things like that. That's what I've felt the last couple of weeks is like, my body's like, this is a machine designed to, to eat the exact foods that it is designed to eat. And I've been unable to get a better grip on those. And so I've been like, I've been really aware like, you know, since the since the since the points that I've been having these problems with sugar, like I've been pretty terrible with food, and it's like, I've been like, I've been a like a bear, a little bit out of balance. And now that I've been in this position where suddenly I'm thinking, like, maybe I'll rewind my diet to try to get down to the healthiest version of the possible highs. And I don't know, maybe I'll get there in the middle or I'll be so fat that it will never go right again. But I've been like, I've got to try this. This is what I've been doing for the last month was like, I've been to the point where I'm thinking well, this is the point where I can feel like I've made a decision. I have to say, though, my wife does come back to me a little bit and says, You're not eating enough. And I can see like, I've been like, Let me tell you why I'm doing it. And I've been eating a bit, but I think that's sort of just because I'm eating quite a bit. I was like, Okay, I need to do this. And I find myself eating like this, like, this triangle of sweet. It's like, I can feel my muscles tensing up, because I know that my body is not designed to. And maybe I'm doing this because I know that my body is not designed to do this.
[Brady] I can see it's the exception and maybe it will be the exception and people will say, Well, you should go to China. But to me, it's the rule of thumb. I mean, I know you're a pretty smart guy. And I know you're, you know, you're, you know, you're pretty intelligent. I mean, you can have people who are really, really stupid. But you're also a pretty smart guy yourself. So I think, I think that's kind of, that's kind of the rule of thumb. I think that's the way it should be. That's the way we should go. But it's the exception. And I think I should go to other places in Asia and in some other parts of the world. But I am pretty happy with the fact that I've now got this extra world of travel that I enjoy. And I think it gives me a greater understanding of people and culture and maybe better understanding of those who think they know everything and have everything. I think it's a good rule of thumb. I think we should be applying the same thing to people when we travel, whether or not they know it's a country that they're going to go to. And whether or not they're you know, are willing or can't you see them? Are they the same? I think that's the rule of thumb.
[Grey] I guess I would say no, because I don't have to actually go to any of those places. I think it's it's best if you know exactly who the people are and where they're from and what their country is, you know, I don't I don't need to go to China to to to travel to China, right? I can just travel to any other place in the world. I understand that point. And so I think that that's a good rule of thumb. I would say yes to that, that if, if China and another place on earth is on your list, or you're trying to get to China, then you should do that. But I, I don't think that that's the case. So I think that that's I think that's a that's a case of you want to go to a place And you know, it's going to be a great trip. I don't I don't think that it's it's not the case. I think if China and another place on Earth is on your list, then you should do that. But I I don't think it's it's mandatory.
[Brady] It's a good rule of thumb. And I can see why it's the case and why it's the case. But I do think and you know, I'm the same I've been going to China for 10 years and I've never once been to China without some of the most intense experiences of my life. Right. And I can honestly say that it changed my life. For the better.
[Grey] I honestly think that that's a fair statement. I do. I do feel that there's a there's a certain kind of, of experiences that I have that I have been through where I have been, I have been more and more I have been more conscious of, like, is this a good place to go? Or is it not a good place to go? I know. I've been to places where I've been like, I've been to places where I know, like, I can recognize a lot of the people and the feeling of the people and I have a much better sense now. Of what's good and what's not. And I think that's had a kind of a interesting experience this time is like, I have been to two places in China, and I have been to the other place. And I've been to the third place, and I have been to the fourth place. It's been just a couple of days. But I have been aware that my brain is getting much more wired into the places that I go. And I'm now aware of the when I get bored in a place, like if I'm walking around, and I see people walking around, like I'm very interested, because I'm interested, but I can't help but notice that when I get bored in a place like if I'm in a restaurant, and I see people ordering food, or if I'm in a hotel, if I'm in a hotel, and I see the people ordering food, like my brain is always looking at those people, like, I wonder what's going on with that? Is that other people? Is that is that me? Is that the eating? Is that the drinking? Is that the levels of wealth that you're describing? I would say no, but it's, it's a different thing, because I'm travelling so much.

[Brady] So Grey, should I talk about the new project I was discussing with you earlier?
[Grey] Yeah, I was Yeah, okay. The one the one that I was talking about is we've been talking for a while about the Scottish independence referendum. And I was I was trying to make this as clear as possible to you.
[Brady] Because I was talking about it last time. I was trying to sort it out as well. Hmm. And I've come to this point. Because I've done it again. I've done it again. And I found it interesting to note that you always seem to be very detached from the Scottish independence referendum. Like, for example, you sent me you sent me a little bit about it and why it happened and how it happened. And I just wanted to point out, you're talking about it now, but last time I was I wasn't talking about it in the context of what's going to happen. That's what I was talking about.
[Grey] Yeah, that's that's that's why last time, I didn't talk about the stuff that I was talking about. And I was I was actually kind of hoping that you would you would explain the situation to me, because last time, when we were talking about, oh, the Scottish independence referendum, it was a very interesting experience for me to be living in the UK, where it seemed like one of the sides that was most united behind the idea of Scottish independence. And I was originally trying to make the case that this is what I would want to do. But it turns out those are who are Be able to vote on changing this so easily and so easily and so easily that the Scottish independence people came out with a constitution that they want to put into the constitution. And so they had a referendum on changing that constitution. And I was like, I'm not saying that I want to talk about that. But it's a topic I have been thinking about for a long time and ever, and I just I really want to talk about it and I find it incredibly frustrating. But let me talk about why I think it's it's happening and why I think it's going on and what I think is going on and what I think is going on and i'll be very talk about my neighborhood in the UK, because this is where I live. But
[Brady] you know, in the US, the the vote totals for President are quite close in the states. And I think it's pretty much 5050 or 5150 about, on average, you know, what's the difference between states and the national elections? I think it's pretty close, maybe the first past the post or plurality vote on a candidate winning in one of the states is about 5050 with the national elections.
[Grey] Yes. Or plurality, the national elections, depending on what state you're in. So I think you can pretty much say that the national election is a kind of first past the post or plurality vote on national ballots. But here's the thing, like I don't I don't like to say these things out loud. But I believe that the way the rules are in the national election system, is that if the parties have a disagreement over how the rules should be set up, the one group that they don't agree to, the national election should be decided by the state. I think that's the way it should work. There should be, there should be some mechanism for disagreement between, like the two houses. But anyway, so I don't I don't like to say these things out loud. But I feel like I have been thinking about this for a long time.
[Brady] I mean, I don't want to be too. I kind of like the sound of it. And I could see how, and I could see how, I mean, I don't I don't know if you feel this way. But I suspect that you would. And I've been having a think about it and thinking about it a bit. And I've now got a bit of a think about how what's going on with the Australian system, and maybe it's different to the way it's worked in the United States. But I think I've, I've had two Eber rides where I've been thinking about the system and where it's been controlling my vote and where I should go but I've also been having a think about like, what do I think about the Australian system and I think that I think the things that are happening and the people who are getting their votes or the people who are about to get their votes, aren't are not fair, and I don't think the rules should be changed. And I don't know whether you feel that or whether you would agree with me or not. But
[Grey] I would say I would agree with you. Right. I think the the system is it's two parties. We have a national level government, making decisions. And we have individual voters who are choosing to go and meet in the national election. But I think that the system is sort of like five or six things at once. And I don't I don't necessarily think that it's better or worse than the way things are in the past. But I, I'm very much in favor of the system that is. So that's
[Brady] the big difference. The problem is, and this is this is what I mean, the problem is, is all these tiny little tiny little tiny little bits of a problem, like, like, a lot of the things that are at play here, do relate to the bigger picture, or do they relate to more you know, the issues at hand? Because, you know, if we're going to have a say, a vote of the majority of the voters, and we're going to have say, oh, and by the way, here's a nice, different way of voting. And you know, there are different ways of doing it. And sometimes it can work well, to say, look, if this is the way we're doing it, and this is how we've always done it, and by the way, this is how we always done it, and we never sound like the bad guys. But that's because by the people we're electing, and we're not going to be saying that this is the best way to run things. Like, I know there are different ways of doing it. But that is at least where the problem is. And that's how we end up with these tiny little bits of problem that just tickle the surface and make us Look like a bit, and then we go off and have a big fight about how best to vote how best to vote, rather than a problem that's about, you know, well, everyone's got their own problems. And that's why we have this problem. Like, you know, there are these little minor skirmishes that happen every once in a while that people can get involved in and trouble that people can get involved in. But this, this little bit of a push to have a different voting system, rather than, you know, having a say in the general election, or voting on a referendum that has more meaning, rather than a problem that's about to happen. There are a few things that happen each time that people can get involved in and trouble that can snowball
[Grey] up. This is again, first past the post, no votes, and I know that people want to talk about other systems, but I, I think that that is a thing that is just so different from what's going to happen. I don't think that that is going to happen. And I also I don't think that it's going to happen as soon as I don't think it has the same kind of effects that a direct runoff system has. But I don't know I don't know how the system works. So I'm just
[Brady] saying it's this competitor to the current system.
[Grey] Yeah, that's that's exactly right. It's this is what you want. But I think that's what I think is that, that the problem that happens is, is that it's easy to get people to agree with the current system, even though like, I think in a perfect world, like I'm pretty convinced that the the current system is better. But because it is very much a case of example of like, it's easy to get people to agree on things even when they don't seem to agree and like it's done well, in many ways. But I think that the the the current system is just so easy to fall into the sort of trap that you fall into of the same bias, the same sort of things. And so that's why I think that that's, that's my concern is like, I don't think this is gonna be a thing that's really great. But I don't think it's a good system. And I don't know. I don't know how this is. I don't think it's very good. Can you elaborate on that?
[Brady] Well, that's an interesting question. I mean, obviously, we have an example of a system that's worked very well in the United States called the Senate, which is the, the body of representatives that, you know, the people to a whole bunch of different states send a representative, which is basically the same but in very many ways, different states. And there are three major problems that are basically the same. And I'm sure I've you know, I'm sure you've seen the example of what I mean. But in the US, the Senate, the majority of the Senate, the whole, the whole thing
